An awesome and organized reference list of evaluation measures and methods for explainable machine learning (XAI) algorithms and systems. If you need more details and descriptions, you can read the [*full paper*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11839.pdf) or visit [my page](http://people.tamu.edu/~sina.mohseni/webpage/research.html) for more resources!


## How to Evaluate XAI?

We reviewed XAI-related research to organize different XAI design goals and evaluation measures. This awesome-list presents our categorization of selected existing design and evaluation methods that organizes literature along three perspectives: **design goals**, **evaluation methods**, and **targeted users** of the XAI system. We provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.
